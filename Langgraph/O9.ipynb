      "3.  **Identifying Relevant Information:** My algorithms are designed to identify key pieces of information (like names, topics, or previous statements) within that conversation history that are relevant to your current input.\n",
      "4.  **Generating a Response:** Based on your current input and the relevant information from our chat history, I formulate my response.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when you said \"hello I am Raj,\" that information became part of our conversation history. When you later asked \"What is my name?\", I looked back at that history, saw \"Raj,\" and was able to tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Crucially:** This memory is temporary and only for *this specific conversation session*. If you were to close this chat window and start a completely new one, I would have no recollection of you being Raj until you told me again. I don't store personal information about users across sessions.\n",
